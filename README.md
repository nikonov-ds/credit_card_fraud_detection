## Credit Card Fraud Detection

In the banking industry, detecting credit card fraud using machine learning is not just a trend; it is a necessity for banks, as they need to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning helps these institutions reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denial of legitimate transactions.

In this case study, three models were built in order to detect credit card fraud: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

The steps taken in the case study include:
* Data Importing and Understanding
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Building a Logistic Regression Model
* Building a Decision Tree Model
* Building a Random Forest Model
* Performing a Cost-Benefit Analysis

The Random Forest Model showed the best result. The Bank will benefit by implementing the model in the following way:

1. Before implementing the model, the bank lost, on average, around **$213,392.22** per month.

2. After implementing the model, the average monthly losses of the bank are estimated to be around **$21,241.07**. Which is around *10\%* of the losses before implementing the model. 

3. This way, saving around **$192,151.15** per month.
